# My Node/express API Template

This is a WIP for a simple(ish) Template I'll be using for my tiny JS backend projects

## Feel free to use 
```
npm i
```
Rename .env.example to .env and populate the variables

```
npm run dev
```

## Features
- Some good folder structuring (Debatable)
- Mongodb integration option (DONE)
- Rate Limiter (DONE)
- JWT Integration with login and logout functionality(DONE)
- Email/Password reset(DONE)
- Unit tests(Thinking about it)

## DEV Refactoring notes (TODOs)
- Better/Centralised error handling 
- A logger would be nice
- Swagger or some open api implementation
